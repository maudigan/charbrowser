	Many new features have been added to streamline the software to make customazation even easier than before.
	Languages have been modularized to better serve our growing Chinese community.
	Modifying the language.php file can now rapidly customize the tool in a way that used to take days. 
	<br> 
	<br> 
	In addition to languages, all of the HTML has been modularized using a system you may recognize from phpbb.
	System admins can now edit easy to understand templates to quickly get a custom feel for their install. 
	<br> 
	<br> 
	Various other navigational upgrades have been made, and security upgrades making it safer for the whole community.

							Great efforts have been made for this software to function as close to <i>in-game</i> as possible. Some noteable things will be covered here, for further assitance, ask the guy sitting next to you first, if he doesnt know please visit the 'Magelo Clone' forum on MQEmulator.net. 
							<br><br> 
							<b>Blocking your profile:</b><br> 
							When installed this software can be setup to hide the accounts of role players and/or anonymous players. To view if either of these options are enabled click the settings link in the top right. 
							<br><br> 
							<b>Information Hiding:</b><br> 
							Just like blocked profiles the server op can choose to block a number of other sections for ALL players such as factions, aas, skills, etc. Again, to view the settings for your server, and to see the full list of options click the settings link in the top right. 
							<br><br> 
							<b>Searching:</b><br> 
							Searching no longer requires the use of wildcards as any spaces are now translated into wildcards. A blank search will return all characters. A search for 'lon ar' will return 'lonestar'. Search results can be sorted by clicking the column headers(only ascending order). 
							<br><br> 
							<b>Inventory, AA, Skills:</b><br> 
							These should all be strikingly similar to the use in game.<br> 
							<br><br> 
							<b>Corpses:</b><br> 
							In the rezzed column, a filled radio button indicates the corpse has been rezzed. If the radio buttons are displayed incorrectly with a white background then you are using IE and a fix for IE's problem can be found <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/'>here</a>.  The zone-name link now takes you to a page with information about the zone instead of a map. Now the [map] link will display a map and attempt to pinpoint your corpse on it for easier location. 
							<br><br> 
							<b>Flags:</b><br> 
							The top flags box will display the flag for each zone you have access to. A filled radio button indicates you have access to that zone. If the radio buttons are displayed incorrectly with a white background then you are using IE and a fix for IE's problem can be found <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/'>here</a>.  Clicking the name on one of these flags will open a subwindow of all the flags required to get access to that zone. This truth table was created from the planar projection quest file and because of this some flags are repeated even when verified in a prerequisite. For instance Askr's flags are checked to get into bot, and then checked again to get into Elementals. 
							<br><br> 
							<b>Faction:</b><br> 
							Faction display can vary based on the server admins settings. A basic view shows the faction name, and your faction level in text. In advanced mode your entire faction table is broken down. Base will show the starting value of the faction, char shows your modifier(from killing/questing/etc), race shows your particular races modifer(frogs hate trolls), class shows your classes modifer for that faction, and deity shows your deity's modifier.
